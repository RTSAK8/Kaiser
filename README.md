Welcome to Kaiser, an innovative web project that seamlessly integrates pure JavaScript and Django.

This project showcases two engaging games, demonstrating the art of crafting a simple yet robust web application.

Whether you're a novice in web development looking to replicate the project or seeking inspiration from specific components of this starter project, I hope this serves as a valuable resource for you.

The project consists of three main parts:

1. **Home Page:** This serves as a welcoming page with minimal instructions.
2. **Grand (or The King of Fighters):** In this section, I've created a simple King of Fighters (KoF) game using pure JS. This marks my initial foray into web development.
3. **Brand (or War of Warlock):** This is a more intricate game that includes an interactive module and an account system, primarily utilizing the powerful capabilities of Django.

Feel free to explore, learn, and adapt these components to enhance your web development skills. Enjoy the journey!
